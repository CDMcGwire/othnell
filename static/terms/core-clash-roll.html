  A <strong>Clash Roll</strong> is when two opposing creatures roll off to
  determine who succeeds and who loses and by how much. The size and number of
  dice used by each creature is determined by their Brawn and any relevant
  equipment or traits.

  Minimum Base Die is d2 for -1 Brawn. Size increases by 1 for every 1 point
  higher Brawn.

<blockquote>So, d2 at -1, d4 at 0, d6 at +1, etc...</blockquote>
