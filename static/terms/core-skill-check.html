<p>
  When a character performs a non-trivial but unopposed action, it invokes a
  skill check. Players by default have a hand of three playing cards they can
  see. When they say they wish to make an action the DM sees fit to challenge,
  the DM will set a value based on an objective difficulty and the player must
  play a card of equal or greater value.
