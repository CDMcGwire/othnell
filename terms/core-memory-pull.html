  Made when a character wishes to reveal knowledge from their character's
  background or to remember new info. The DM will pull a card and keep the value
  hidden. All player's making the attempt will then pull 1 card plus an
  additional one for each point of Memory. If any card matches the DM’s in suit
  or rank the DM must give correct and forthright information. The DM will not
  reveal their card.

  At negative values of Memory, the player must draw additional cards equal to
  the number of negative points, but EVERY card must match suit or rank with the
  DM’s card.
