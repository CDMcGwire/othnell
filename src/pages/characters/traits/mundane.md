Mundane Traits are acquired every level. They help define your character and
improve their capabilities, but not in ways that would be particularly
_exceptional_.

Put another way, a Mundane Trait would differentiate a body builder from a
runner, but would not do well to tell you which body builder could carry the
heaviest load or which could bend steel with his legs.

## High Attribute Traits

Traits acquired automatically by having a +3 in the associated attribute.

### Inspiring (Charisma) <ref-adder mutation="addMundaneTrait" target="inspiring" />

_Your personal Charm is downright infectious. You bring an extra spark to your
party and things go just a bit smoother when you're around._

If you have at least +1 in another attribute, you gain an additional effect.

- **Brawn)** The next ally to make a Clash Roll against a creature you
  <term target="intimidate">intimidate</term> gets advantage on that action.
- **Poise)** If a nearby ally is about to make a Skill Check, you may trade one
  card from your hand with one from theirs, if they are willing. **_Only one
  card may be traded per check made._**
- **Memory)** Nearby allies may perform the
  <term target="deceive">decieve</term> action as if they have a Charisma of +2.
- **Wit)** You can ask nearby teammates to donate a cognition token towards your
  attempts to <term target="persuade">persuade</term>. **_Max one token per teammate, per attempt._**
