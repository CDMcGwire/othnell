Mundane Traits are acquired every level. They help define your character and
improve their capabilities, but not in ways that would be particularly
_exceptional_.

Put another way, a Mundane Trait would differentiate a body builder from a
runner, but would not do well to tell you which body builder could carry the
heaviest load or which could bend steel with his legs.
