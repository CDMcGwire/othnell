Traits are additional effects and gameplay modifiers that your character
acquires can acquire. Your character will begin with two Mundane traits, then
gain more as they level.

## [Attribute Traits](traits/attribute)

This section contains the list of Attribute traits, which are acquired
automatically based on your character's attributes. They do not count towards
your initial or future selections, but **if you have a -1 or +3 in at least one
attribute, read this section.**

## [Mundane Traits](traits/mundane)

This section contains the list of available Mundane traits. Mundane traits are
what define you compared to the average person, but aren't so exceptional as to
make you stand out from among all of your species.

## [Exceptional Traits](traits/exceptional)

This section contains the list of available Exceptional traits. Exceptional
traits are the parts of your character which make heads turn, inspire stories
and songs, and build your reputation in lands you've never seen.
