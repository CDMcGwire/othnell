Proficiencies define your character's areas of expertise. They determine if your
character has the training and knowledge needed to perform specialized tasks.
Such as forging a sword, picking a complex lock, or reciting long passages of a
holy text.

From a gameplay perspective, having proficiency lets you make Clash Rolls, Skill
Checks, Memory Draws, and spend Cognition on related tasks without extreme
penalties. The DM may even decide that some task is entirely impossible without
proficiency.

## Magic

Magic comes is a wide variety of origins and forms and as such proficiency in
one "arte" of magic does not imply proficiency in any other. Having proficiency
in an arte is the first requirement to allow your character to use its spell,
rituals, and techniques.
