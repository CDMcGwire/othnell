Traits are additional effects and gameplay modifiers that your character
acquires can acquire. Your character will begin with some then gain more as they
level.

## Attribute Traits

If your character has an extreme value in an attribute (+3 or greater or -1 and
less) they automatically acquire an associated trait.

### High Attribute Traits

- **Mighty (Brawn) -** If you succeed a Clash Roll by 5 or more, roll a d6 and
  add the result.
- **Graceful (Poise) -** After succeeding at a Skill Check, the player may
  discard and redraw one card from their hand.
- **Studious (Memory) -** The player does not need to make Memory Pulls when the
  information is related to one of their proficiencies.
- **Good Instincts (Wit) -** When wagering Cognition points on a hidden cost,
  the DM must announce if you were too low, after which the player gets one
  chance to up their wager.
- **Inspiring (Charisma) -** The player's Charisma actions have team based
  bonuses.
  - **Intimidate -** The next ally to act against a target you intimidated gets
    advantage.
  - **Charm -** The player and a willing, nearby ally may swap one card from
    each other's hand when that ally is making a skill check (before the play a
    card, but after the DC is announced).
  - **Lie -** Nearby allies may make their own Lie actions at a temporary
    Charisma bonus of +2 if their own is lower.
  - **Persuade -** Willing, nearby allies may contribute up to 2 Cognition
    points towards your Persuade attempt.

> For the **Inspiring** trait, and in other rules that specify a _nearby_
> character, nearby means that a reasonable explanation can be made for how one
> character could directly assist another.

### Low Attribute Traits

- **Frail (Brawn) -** If you lose a Clash Roll by 5 or more, you become
  defenseless for one turn.
- **Clumsy (Poise) -** After failing a Skill Check, draw another card. If the
  value is also under the DC, something bad happens.
- **Forgetful (Memory) -** Must make a memory pull when attempting to pass on
  important info.
- **Dim (Wit) -** Can't spend Cognition points without an ally nearby. Must
  spend a cognition point to read or to manipulate a mechanism that requires a
  skill check.
- **Repulsive (Charisma) -** The player must pass a Charisma check of their
  choice when approaching a sentient character. If it fails, that character will
  attempt to avoid the player. If the character has a good reason, they may
  become openly hostile.

## Mundane Traits

At character creation, you begin with 2 mundane traits and every level after
they will gain another.
