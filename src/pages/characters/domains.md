## Domains

Characters start with and can acquire 'Domains' of expertise or lack thereof. If
an action is within a characters domain of expertise, they have advantage by
default. If it's within their domain of ignorance, they have disadvantage by
default.

### Starting Domains

At character creation, you may choose one of the following sets of domains:

- 1 Expertise
- 3 Expertises & 2 Ignorances
- 4 Expertises & 4 Ignorances
- 5 Expertises & 6 Ignorances

### Making a Breakthrough

As a character faces and overcomes trials (or learns from their failure to do
so), their level of expertise in a domain may grow.
