# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

The art of performing miracles. Spells and rituals of this practice break the
known rules of the world quite literally. Such as bringing the dead back to
life, changing water to wine, or bringing down a pillar of searing light in the
pitch dark of a cave.

The cost of these miracles is based on the edicts of the worker's patron. The
practitioner is expected to lead a life dedicated to the teachings of their
patron and in return the patron lends their power in times of need.

However, if the patron allows, the practitioner may incur a sort of karmic debt
should they need a greater miracle than their past faith has earned. If the
deity or spirit sees the purpose of the miracle as worthy of their power, then
they will not deny their follower. But in return the follower must peform some
sort of penance, else they be destroyed outright for their blasphemy.
